# Week 6, Day 2 Review - React Redux

Before jumping in, ask for any questions. Try to structure the review around their questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.

## Lecture Notes and Slides

- Notes: https://github.com/WLH-16/react-6-deprecated
- Slides: https://slides.com/matias_perez/redux-react-redux

## Important Concepts to Review

1. What is a global state manager? When is it useful?
2. The Redux pattern
   - Store
   - Reducer
   - Connect HOC
      - `mapStateToProps`
      - `mapDispatchToProps`

## Review

It may make sense before starting the coding exercise below to walk through the flow of redux in the application. Take it slow to help the students understand each of the different stages associated with the dataflow using Redux - feel free to use the dataflow image from the lecture slides [here](https://slides.com/matias_perez/redux-react-redux#/3) to walk through this process.

The rest of the review will consist of [this](https://github.com/andrewwestenskow/redux-review) repo. There are instructions in the repo itself that will guide the review.
