//JAVASCRIPT 1 REVIEW
//Many of these problems will require you to console log certain values.  To do this we use:
console.log("A value");
//Click run to test your values.

//Data types
//What are our known data types?
/*
TYPE YOUR ANSWERS HERE


*/

//Variables
//Declare a variable called name and give it a value of your name as a string.  Log it to the console.

//Create an array called nums which will hold the numbers 1 - 5

//Create an object called person, this object should have 3 key value pairs: name, which should be your name, age which should be your age, and hobbies which should be an array of 3 strings, each a hobby you enjoy.  Console log the first item in this array.
//HINT: You will need to use both dot and bracket notation to access this item

//Reassigning Variables
let instructor = "Billy Bob";
//Reassign the instructor variable to have a value of Matt


//If statements
let age = 15;
//Write an if statement that checks the value of the age variable.
//If age is greater than 16, console log 'You can drive' otherwise console log 'You cannot drive'

//Write an if statement that checks the following:
//If age is between 0 and 12, console log 'You could still go to hogwarts'
//If age is between 13 and 17 console log 'You probably won't go to hogwarts'
//If age is 18 or greater console log 'Hogwarts is right out'

//Write an if statement that checks if age is equal to 16 or 21.  If it is, console log 'what a big year' otherwise console log 'no big deal'

//Write an if statement that checks if age is not 22.  If so, console log 'feeling normal'  otherwise, console log 'Feeling 22'

//Try changing the value of the age variable to get different results from your if statements

//What are some examples of falsy values?
/* TYPE YOUR ANSWERS HERE





*/

let cheat = false;

//Create an if statement that checks to see if cheating is a falsy value - if it is return 'falsy'; if not, return 'truthy'

//Functions
//Write a function called sum that takes two parameters.  Both of these should be numbers. The function should return the sum of the two numbers. Write it first as a function declaration and then again as a function expression.

//Write a function called whatAmI which takes two parameters, a name and a job.
//It should return a string of 'Yer a job, name'
//For example, passing 'Harry' and 'wizard' as arguments would return 'Yer a wizard, Harry'  Invoke the function passing in different values to test it.
//HINT: Try using template strings on this one
