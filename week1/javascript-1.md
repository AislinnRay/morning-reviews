# Week 1, Day 3 Review - Javascript 1

Before jumping in, ask for any questions. Try to structure the review around their questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.

## REVIEW

Give them [this](https://repl.it/@LucasSchaat/javascript-1-morning-review) repo. Give them 15 minutes to work as far as they can and then go through it together. Answer any questions along the way.

If that repl is no longer available, it is identical to the `javascript-1` file in this repo.
