# Week 5, Day 5 Review - React 4 - Routing

This morning review may or may not be delivered at this point of the course schedule - depending on how and when the second Skills Check is administered. Typically, students are given the entirety of the day on this scheduled day of the course to work on the second Skills Check. If this is the case, this review would probably best be delivered during the morning review of the next lecture day of class (i.e., during the Week 6, Day 1 morning review).

Regardless of when this is delivered, try to structure the review around the students' questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.
