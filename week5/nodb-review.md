# Week 5, Day 2 Review - Fixing Broken Code Review

NOTE: Given that students are just finishing their noDB or 3/4 Stack projects, the content for this review should be pretty flexible. Use this time as an opportunity to help students review concepts that they may have found difficult as part of their projects. The below suggested review content is for helping students walk through broken code and practice their debugging skills.

This review is meant to help students practice debugging broken code by following error messages in the console and placing `console.log`'s through their code to understand how data is flowing from step to step. The code that students will be trying to debug can be found [here](https://repl.it/@matias_perez/Debugging-Morning-Review-Broken).

The solution code for this exercise can be found [here](https://repl.it/@matias_perez/Debugging-Morning-Review-Solved).

## Important Concepts to Review

1. Debugging Errors in the Console
2. Placing `console.log`'s to Track Data Flow

## Review

- Start by giving students 10-15 minutes to walk through the code, familiarize themselves with the JavaScript problem, and begin debugging the code
- After 10-15 minutes, begin walking with the students how to go about solving / debugging the code. The key to this review is less about arriving to the final solution and more about helping students understand the methodology for approaching problems in their code
- Focus first on clearing the errors appearing in the console - make this review interactive and have the students help you solve these problems
- After all of the errors in the console have been resolved, walk through the code with the students, focusing on dataflow and data types in the code. Feel free to use `console.log`'s to demonstrate what is happening at different steps in the code until you get to the solution
- Also, don't be afraid to search the internet with the students to better understand the JavaScript syntax/methods/etc. they may not be familiar with
