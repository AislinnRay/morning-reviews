# Javascript 5 Review

## Important concepts to cover

- this and context
- constructor functions
  - The `new` keyword
- prototypes

## Review

- Start out by reviewing context and the this keyword with students

  - Context is the value of this
  - this is a placeholder for the object to which a method or property belong
    - Review explicit, implicit, and default context
      - default: window (different in node)
      - implicit: inside of a function declaration
      - explicit: call, apply, bind

- After reviewing, give the students about 15 minutes to work through [this](https://repl.it/@awestenskow/javascript-5-review) repl then go through the answers with them.
