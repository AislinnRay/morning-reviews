# Week 3, Day 2 Review - JavaScript 6

Before jumping in, ask for any questions. Try to structure the review around their questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.

## Important Concepts to Review

1. Classes
    - Most of the review time should be spent focused on this topic. Students will spend lots of time building classes as they build out stateful components in React, so a thorough review of this topic will be helpful heading into React content
2. Closures
    - Closure functions are inner functions that have been returned from an outer function
    - These functions are scoped based on the outer function's scope
    - Module pattern is a term in closure functions that refers to the creation of "private" variables and functions - this pattern only allows access to those variables / functions via the functions that are returned as part of the closure

## Review

- You can use [this](https://repl.it/@LucasSchaat/JavaScript-6-review-solution) repo as a guide for this review - this version has the solution code. The student version of this file is provided here [this](https://repl.it/@LucasSchaat/JavaScript-6-review). This review is meant to be pretty simple so students can draw the connections between constructor functions and classes. Lots of students struggle with the concept of the super method, make sure to take time explaining what is happening inside of the class setup.
