# Week 2, Day 4 - Javascript Review

<strong>IMPORTANT: The following code is a framework for the JavaScript review lecture, not a morning review for Week 2, Day 5 of the course</strong>

This review should be centered around the skills check that is given at the end of Week 2. It can be found [here](https://github.com/DevMountain/web-week2-skillscheck). This review can go for as long as students still have questions. This guide will cover generally which topics should be covered but it's a good idea to ask the day before for questions students have and spend more time on those topics.

## Review

The review will be done using [this](https://repl.it/@awestenskow/javascript-review) repl. Feel free to fork it an make any necessary changes before sending out to your students. It can also be found [here](javascript-review.js). Have them code along to give them a solid set of reference code.

We will review the following topics:

- Declaring variables
  - var
  - let
  - const
- Data types
  - Primitive
    - string
    - number
    - boolean
    - undefined
    - null
