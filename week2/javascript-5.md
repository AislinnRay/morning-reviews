# Week 2, Day 4 Review - JavaScript 5

This morning review may or may not be delivered at this point of the course schedule - depending on instructor preference. Some instructors may choose to use the morning review time on this day to begin the javaScript review lecture and instead delay this review until after the first javaScript skills check has been completed. That said, communicate with the instructor to make sure that you are both on the same page when it comes to the morning review schedule for this day.

As always, before jumping into this review, ask for any questions. Try to structure the review around their questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.

## Review

- Start out by reviewing context and the this keyword with students

  - Context is the value of this
  - this is a placeholder for the object to which a method or property belongs
    - Review explicit, implicit, and default context
      - default: window (different in node)
      - implicit: inside of a function declaration
      - explicit: call, apply, bind

- After reviewing, give the students about 15 minutes to work through [this](https://repl.it/@LucasSchaat/javascript-5-review) repl then go through the answers with them that are provided [here](https://repl.it/@LucasSchaat/javaScript-5-review-solution).
