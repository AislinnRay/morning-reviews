# Important concepts to review

- Layout
  - This is the most important thing they can practice as it will apply all other html/css techniques.
- Flexbox
  - This will dictate how they lay out their sites, should be a focus

## Review

This review will take the form of an exercise. We will provide a photo and they will clone it.

- Use [this](https://github.com/DevMountain/Morning-Exercises/tree/master/Week%204/3%20Facebook%20Post) repo if it is still working.
  - They should focus on layout, not necessarily on content. Get everything to show up where you want it, don't worry about it looking perfect.
- You should work along with the students and after 20ish minutes review with them what you did and your thought process in cloning this post.
- Break down for them the various pieces of the facebook post, how you break it down into boxes and then smaller boxes.
