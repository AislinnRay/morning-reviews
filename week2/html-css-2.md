# Week 2, Day 2 Review - HTML / CSS 2

Before jumping in, ask for any questions. Try to structure the review around their questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.

## Important Concepts to Review

1. Layout
  - This is the most important thing they can practice as it will apply all other HTML / CSS techniques.
2. Flexbox
  - This will dictate how they lay out their sites, should be a main focus for the review
3. Position Properties (static, relative, fixed, absolute, sticky) & z-index
4. Display Properties (block, inline, inline-block)
5. Overflow
6. Box Shadow

## Main Review

This review will take the form of an exercise. We will provide a photo and they will clone it.

- Use [this](https://github.com/DevMountain/Morning-Exercises/tree/master/Week%204/3%20Facebook%20Post) repo if it is still working.
  - They should focus on layout, not necessarily on content. Get everything to show up where you want it, don't worry about it looking perfect.
  - Feel free to refer to the fbPostPractice folder included in this repo for a step-by-step example for walking through and building this view according to [this](https://github.com/DevMountain/Morning-Exercises/tree/master/Week%204/3%20Facebook%20Post)
- You should work along with the students and after 20ish minutes review with them what you did and your thought process in cloning this post.
- Break down for them the various pieces of the facebook post, how you break it down into boxes and then smaller boxes.
