# Week 7, Day 3 Review - Advanced Javascript Review

Depending on how well students were able to conceptualize the topics from this lecture, it may make sense to use a combination of the following exercises as part of this morning review. As always, before jumping in, ask for any questions. Try to structure the review around their questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.

## Important Concepts to Review

1. React Hooks
    - useState
    - useEffect
2. HOC Components
2. Render Props

## Review

Because most students tend to practice using Hooks as part of projects moving forward and because most students don't tend to use render props or Higher Order Components in their personal projects, I find that this time is well spent walking students through the full stack debugging exercise that they potentially could have started as part of Option #2 from the morning review exercise from the previous day's lecture. I find that this exercise works best when students are given some time to try debugging the application themselves before walking through it together as a class.

The full stack debugging exercise repoo can be found [here](https://github.com/LucasSchaat/how_meme_full_stack_app). Students should fork and clone this project, run `npm install`, and create a .env file for storing their local environmental vairables (SERVER_PORT, CONNECTION_STRING, and SESSION_SECRET). They should also have used the init.sql file to initialize their database and could have even created a few pieces of sample data to be displayed once they are able to get the application running.

From there, you should walk-through the full stack debugging exercise with students adding console logs and talking through how to go about solving the bugs along the way. It is helpful when the students have tried it so that they can help debug the application as well. Be methodical and deliberate in solving the problems and feel free to look [here](https://github.com/LucasSchaat/how_meme_full_stack_app/commit/09baebf254562517cfc350199ecdc313a20653ae) for the solution code changes to the file. These changes are the commit changes that were made with the "Intentionally added bugs for debugging practice" commit message.
