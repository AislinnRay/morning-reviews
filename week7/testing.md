# Week 7, Day 4 Review

Given that this is the last morning review that students receive before jumping into personal projects, I have found that this is a good time to ask students what they have questions on and prioritize those questions first. If there are no questions, now would be a good time to review with students the importance of structuring DB tables and information correctly (a review of SQL-2).

See the note from the SQL-2 - Week 6, Day 4 morning review [here](../week6/sql-2)

If this morning review has already been delivered, have the students work through a whiteboarding exercise, some CodeWars problems, or have them work through some sort of additional debugging practice.
